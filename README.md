# Krusty Krab Simulator

This small project is a simulator of how an order would be taken at the Krusty Krab, which is a fictional resturnat in the poplular series: SpongeBob. 

## how to order

The user will be given a menu that lists all entree options with their corresponding number. The number of desired entrees is asked in the begining.
For example if a user would like 4 krabby patties, they would enter 4 on how many entrees they would like and enter the number "7" 4 indivsual times after.
Once this is complete they are then asked for the sides, drinks and finnaly condiments, after all the information is given it will output the total price of all the items.
